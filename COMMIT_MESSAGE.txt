Fix: Replace Link with anchor in Button asChild patterns for production build

Root cause: Button asChild + Link pattern breaks Next.js production builds due to ref-forwarding issues.
Works in dev mode but fails in production webpack compilation.

Files fixed:
- app/(marketing)/components/StickyCTA.jsx
  • Replaced Link with anchor in Button asChild (1 instance)
  • Removed unused Link import

- app/(marketing)/components/Navbar.jsx
  • Replaced Link with anchor in Button asChild (2 instances)
  • Replaced Link with anchor for fragment links (3 instances)
  • Removed unused Link import

- app/(marketing)/components/Hero.jsx
  • Removed unused Link import

- app/(marketing)/components/CTA.jsx
  • Removed unused Link import

- app/(marketing)/components/Footer.jsx
  • Replaced Link with anchor for fragment links (2 instances)
  • Kept Link for route navigation (/get-started, /login, /privacy, /terms)

Documentation:
- Updated DEPLOYMENT_FIX.md with root cause analysis
- Added PRODUCTION_BUILD_FIX_COMPLETE.md with comprehensive fix documentation

Result:
✅ All production builds now successful
✅ All 16 routes compile correctly
✅ Ready for deployment

Best practice established:
- Use <a> tags with Button asChild for fragment/external links
- Wrap Button with Link for route navigation
- Never nest Link inside Button asChild
